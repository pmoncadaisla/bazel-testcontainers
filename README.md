# Bazel Testcontainers

This repository is just a proof of concept of a Java application what uses [Testcontainers](https://www.testcontainers.org/) for testing.

In this PoC we will:
1. Test if we can build a Bazel project locally using Testcontainers
2.  Test if we can build a Bazel project remotely using Testcontainers and Bazel RBE ([Remote Build Execution](https://docs.bazel.build/versions/master/remote-execution.html)) in Google Cloud RBE.


## 1. Locally
